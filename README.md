# 🎯 Lead Scoring Assignment – Predicting Lead Conversion  

## 📝 Project Overview  
This project focuses on **predicting lead conversion** using machine learning. By analyzing lead attributes such as **source, demographics, activity levels, and interactions**, the model helps businesses improve **sales efficiency and marketing targeting strategies**.  

## 🔍 Objectives  
- Build a **classification model** to predict the probability of lead conversion.  
- Identify the most **important features** influencing lead conversion rates.  
- Optimize **threshold selection** to balance precision and recall.  
- Provide actionable insights to **increase sales conversion rates**.  

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning Model:** Logistic Regression  
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook  

## 📂 Dataset  
- The dataset consists of lead attributes, including:  
  - **Lead Source (Organic, Ads, Referral, etc.)**  
  - **User Demographics (Age, Country, Industry, etc.)**  
  - **Activity Data (Website Visits, Email Clicks, etc.)**  
  - **Lead Conversion Status (1 = Converted, 0 = Not Converted)**

## 📊 Key Analysis Steps  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.  
2. **EDA & Feature Selection:** Identifying patterns and correlations in lead conversion.  
3. **Model Implementation:** Training a **logistic regression model** and evaluating performance.  
4. **Threshold Optimization:** Adjusting classification thresholds for better lead segmentation.  

## 📌 Key Findings  
- **Lead source plays a crucial role in conversion probability.**  
- **Customer interactions (e.g., website visits, email opens) have strong predictive power.**  
- **Optimized thresholding improves recall without sacrificing precision.**  

## 🚀 How to Run the Project  
- The code is written in the jupyter notebook 
- So just download code file(lead_scoring_model.ipynb) and dataset (Leads)
- Then execute the notebook file
